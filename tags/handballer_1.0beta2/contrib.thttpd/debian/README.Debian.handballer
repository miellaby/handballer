handballer for debian
-----------------------

"/etc/init.d/handballer stop" will immediately close thttpd's listening socket,
but will not terminate thttpd's existing connections. This allows you to
cleanly shutdown thttpd without harming connections in progress.
"/etc/init.d/handballer force-stop" will immediately kill thttpd, closing
its listening socket as well as existing connections.
