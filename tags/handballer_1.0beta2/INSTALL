To build:

    % ./configure

    Edit config.h to change the configuration options if necessary.

    % make


To install:

    % make install

    Edit one of your system rc files to run thttpd at boot time.  Do NOT
    run it from inetd, that setup is inefficient so thttpd doesn't support it.

For additional information, please look at the original thttpd install notes.
