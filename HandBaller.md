HandBaller is a intentionaly mispelled "frenglish" for "[Handballeur](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handballeur)", which means "handball player".

This word refers actually to the american handball sport where players hit a small ball with their own hands. HandBaller HTTP Bus works as well. It sends back small bits of data (message) without handling them.

Moreover HandBaller word (or handballer, I don't really care with the case) might be abbreviated into "HB" then expansed back into "HTTP Bus"! How cool!

Actually, I tried to be smart. I apologize.
